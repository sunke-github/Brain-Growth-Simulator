# Brain-Growth-Simulator
The neuron is a kind of cell that consumes nutrition in our body. I use the hebb rule, delta rule and survival model to build a simulator to explore the way of the neuron organization and why a group of neurons can evolve to intelligence.

##Background
I am a fan of neural networks. From little creature to human kind, all the brains are combined with neuron.
